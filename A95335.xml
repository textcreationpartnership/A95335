            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>Gentlemen Souldiers, ſometimes you know its better to make an honourable retreat, then to hazard your country, by engaging an over-pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erful enemy, and many times more diſcretion by far: So whether it be not much more conveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent for your ſelves and this Nation, to retreat from this heap of confuſion, diſorder, and incer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainties, wherein we are now plunged, to that ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlement, with ſome amendments, wherein the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerality of the Nation of late did ſo much re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyce.</p>

               <item>2 Becauſe in ſo doing you will diſcharge a good

               <item>3 You will wipe off that calumny and reproach which will for ever remain upon you and your poſterity, of being ſome of you perjured and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſworn, except Sir <hi>H.

               </gap>t 80 perſons, when the compleat number ſhould be neer five hundred, and yet theſe Gentlemen have the confidence of terming them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves the Parliament, the Repreſentatives of the People, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and doubtleſs eſteem it not an ace leſs then <hi>Treaſon</hi> for any man to deliver his opinion otherwiſe. Now ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe theſe Gentlemen ſhould truſt an Army of ten thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand men (as the people hath truſted them) to defend ſuch a country or place; this Army, through the caſualty of war, and the like, are reduced to about fifteen hundred, or two thouſand at moſt; but ſo it is, having power in their hands. they will admit of no other ſupply, though there be the ſame reaſon, hazard and danger, as at firſt; would not this Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament judge and conceive, think you, that theſe were dangerous perſons, and ran a direct courſe to hazard, over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn, and ruine all: or for the <hi>Eaſt-India</hi> Company to ſend a 100 Factors and Agents to manage their affairs to their beſt advantage in the <hi>Eaſt-Indies,</hi> and that eighty or more of this hundred ſhould miſcarry by the way, do you think it either fit, or would it not be preſumption for the twenty re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maining,
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:168650:4"/>
               <!-- PDF PAGE 16 -->to undertake that truſt, and the mannagement of that, which was both truſted, ordered, and diſpoſed of for a hundred; or having power in their hands, they will admit of no other help or aſſiſtance from their imployers, whoſe ſervants they are. Now the plain and naked caſe is, that if ſuch a kind of demeanour was to be ſeen in, and practiſed by others whether it were not moſt abominable, tyrannical, and the greateſt uſurpation lightly imaginable.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> becauſe the people of <hi>England,</hi> yea, according to their own qualifications and rules, have intruſted other perſons to ſit in Parliament ſeveral times ſince; and if this be a rule, which doubtleſs it is, that the people were not made for Parliaments, but Parliaments were made and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtituted for the peoples good, then the people, and their ſenſe and notion of things, ought to be preferred, accepted, and entertained before ten or twenty mens apprehenſions of things, for the reſt ſtand but for cyphers, who are only a remnant, or a broken end of a rejected and diſtrusted Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament: for it is a ſtrange Soleciſme in <hi>Oeconomy,</hi> or go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verning a mans family, or houſhold affairs, that I ſhall not have liberty to alter or change my ſervants, though under the greateſt truſt, if I have opportunity put into my hand to fit my ſelf (as I conceive) with more able, honeſt, and faithful perſons; and having thus furniſhed and fitted my ſelf, that the old ſervants that I rejected, finding me either from home, or otherwiſe diſpoſe of my ſelf, ſhould thruſt themſelves into my imployment without my conſent, leave, or approbation, is certainly a temper not to be endured or tolerated amongſt men.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> becauſe the preſent power did not only allow, but approve and commend the Armies act in diſſolving or incapacitating their Brethren in 1648. although they were the major or prevailing part of that Parliament; then if the Armies power and practiſe was good and commendable in 1648. upon the moſt eminent and prevailing part of a Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament, what is it that hath made the difference, that their power and practiſe was not as good in 1653. upon them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves?
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:168650:4"/>
               <!-- PDF PAGE 16 -->For certainly if I allow and approve of any thing done to my brother, I cannot diſallow or diſapprove of the ſame thing done to my ſelf: ſo that it plainly appears, that if the Armies authority was good which they exerciſed upon their brethren, their Fellow-Truſtees, it muſt needs be good alſo upon themſelves; and if it were neither law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful to the one, nor to the other in 1648. nor in 1653. then ought they all to return to their truſt, had not the people paſſed their judgement, and delegated their truſt to others in the mean time: ſo that theſe three things conſidered, the queſtion and caſe of conſcience is, how either they, or any man elſe, can lawfully give them the terms and appel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations of a Parliament, the Repreſentatives of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2 <hi>Caſe.</hi> How then in conſcience can theſe Gentlemen thus impoſe or irrogate themſelves upon the people as their Parliament, when they have not their approbation or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, let any mans conſcience but ſpeak, without quench<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, ſmotheting, or diverting it? and will it not ſpeak uſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pation and tyranny, becauſe the people of <hi>England</hi> have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes thought meet, being aſſembled in Parliament, to have their full number? Now for theſe Gentlemen to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prive the poor people of their native right, that they can have either none, or as good as none to plead for their rights, and to keep this poor Nation in quiet.</p>
            <p>Whether the thirty tyrants of <hi>Athens</hi> ever exerciſed greater injury to the <hi>Athenians,</hi> then is now impoſed and offered to this poor Land, for we are ſubjected to the wills of ſuch a number, both lives and fortunes; and yet that which is worſt of all, we are flapt i'th' mouth with a free Parliament, a Commonwealth-Government, a Free-State: even as <hi>David</hi> ſaid, <hi>Their words are ſmother then oyl, but they have war in their hearts:</hi> and as the Scripture ſpeaks elſewhere<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
               <hi>ye have a name to live, but indeed are dead.</hi> By this rule we ſhall ſhortly be brought to believe any thing, as the poor blind Papiſts are; if their Leaders ſay that fleſh is fiſh, they will eat it, though on a Friday, which
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:168650:5"/>
               <!-- PDF PAGE 17 -->otherwiſe they would not. It's to be feared we ſhall ſhort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly call and term all things by contrariety, light darkneſs, midnight noon-day, for we begin fair, calling our greateſt thraldomes liberty, and where we are moſt deprived of our rights, freedome, and run our ſelves into the greateſt dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers that we may do ſo: but theſe things conſidered, which is but a touch, God knows, of what might be ſaid, how can theſe Gentlemen, nay thoſe men of conſcience (for ſo I believe of ſome of them) term themſelves the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, the peoples Truſtees, and not bluſh, and their conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences not fly in their faces.</p>
            <p n="3">3 <hi>Caſe.</hi> How in conſcience then can theſe perſons in power diſpence with, or how dare they to preſume the ſell<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing or diſpoſing of any publike Lands and Revenues, or im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe any tax upon the people: (beſide the inconveniency of laying taxes for if ſome Counties have no Truſtees, they are like to bear the burden of the reſt) and if any per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons ſhould buy or ſell with theſe men, whoſe authority is ſo queſtionable, certainly they had need have great penny<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worths; but it may be if they ſell any, the money may be ſpent in another Country; but <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 word">

Shall not the God of all the earth do right, when you even forced him, or rather over-perſwaded him to diſſolve the laſt and moſt free Parliament? what promiſes, what vows, what ingagements was then made, and before; all that I can deſire is, that you were free from them, and diſobliged: Are your vows, and promiſes, and ingagements at <hi>Triploe-Heath,</hi> at St. <hi>Albones</hi> ſo ſacred, as to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſted upon, even upon the hazard of all, and thoſe ſince under your hands to the Protector, and other large teſtimonies and acknowledgements now to be of no force; certainly if thoſe promiſes, addreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, beſides proclamations and ingagements, both publike and private, be not according to the tenour of them fulfill'd, and you go out of the world without ſome characters of divine vengeance, its much, and will be a temptation for all men to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage, ſwear, vow, promiſe, and all that can be done by men, and not much matter whether they
